<h1>The Best Movies According to Sharon</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Highway</h3>
<p>
  This is an drama about a young woman who gets accidently kidnapped. As a child
  abuse survivor she finds freedom in company of her captor.
</p>
<h3>Rockstar</h3>
<p>
  One of my most favourite movies. It has fantastic music. It is a story about
  an amatuer musician who finds his inner voice after experiencing a breakup and
  is kicked out of his home and experiences homelessness.
</p>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>
  I can watch this movie any number of times. Its a light hearted movie about 3
  young men on a bachelor trip to Spain. Every frame of this movie is so
  beautiful
